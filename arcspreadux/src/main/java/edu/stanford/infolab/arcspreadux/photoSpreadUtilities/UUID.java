 * The UUID class produces (hopefully) globally unique
 * identifiers for a number of Java build-in, and PhotoSpread
 * specific objects. We use an implementation of the Rabin hash
 * function. This method is fast, and offers a probability
 * of collision bounded by:
 *                          n*m^2
 *                          -----
 *                          2^64
 * where n is the number of binary strings hashed, and
 * m is the length of the longest string.
 * 
 * See the constructors for the hashing strategies used
 * for different objects. In particular, image files can
 * be hashed using only a sampling of the files, speeding
 * up the process.
