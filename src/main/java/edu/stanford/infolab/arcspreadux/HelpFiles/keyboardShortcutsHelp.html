    <h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<h3>Editor Window<h3>
Purpose: save on frequent drag/drop actions, replacing them with a keyboard shortcut. You will define a key stroke and a destination cell in this editor. Later, you can select items in other cells or in the workspace, and copy them to the destination cell by entering the keystroke. You can define as many of these shortcuts as you like.
